UWA's student population is growing, putting pressure on the limited spaces available for parking. Long times spent searching for a parking space raises stress levels and also increases UWA's carbon footprint. The task in this project is to research, design, and prototype a system to provide accurate information on parking availability to students and staff driving to campus. The project team will have access to design briefs for this problem developed by CITS4419 students. A prototype may be implemented with low cost hardware such as a Raspberry Pi and camera or using on-ground vehicle detection sensors. A driving-safe mobile phone app should be developed for the user interface. The project team may have the opportunity to present and receive feedback from UWA's EZONE design group.
